Denison CS173 Group Assignment 2

We will submit (electronically via Canvas in addition to printed hardcopy):

Our Complex.cpp file 
Our tester program (main.cpp)
All methods should be properly commented with:

Method name
Name of developer (person who coded the method)
Description of what the method does
Parameter list – type and any constraints of the parameters
Return value – type and description of the return value. Note where calling objects are changed since this is a “hidden return”.
