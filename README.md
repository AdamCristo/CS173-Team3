# CS173-Team3

**Denison CS173 Group Assignment 2**    

Group Members: Taemin, Adam, Tri, Damian

We will submit (electronically via Canvas in addition to printed hardcopy):

1. Our Complex.cpp file 

2. Our tester program (main.cpp)


All methods should be properly commented with:

* Method name

* Name of developer (person who coded the method)

* Description of what the method does

* Parameter list – type and any constraints of the parameters

* Return value – type and description of the return value. Note where calling objects are changed since this is a “hidden return”.
